* Intro

Programming languages can be one, or a combination of these when it comes to types:

- strongly typed
- weakly typed
- statically typed
- dynamically typed

JavaScript is dynamically typed. That does not mean it is “untyped”. Whether it is weakly or strongly typed, though, is a matter of debate.
