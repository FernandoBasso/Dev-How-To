# 04 Union and Intersection Types



https://livebook.manning.com/book/programming-with-types/about-this-book/



type:

- classification of data
- meaning of data
- operations that can be performed on that data
- set of allowed values



`any` and `unknown` are TOP TYPES. They encompass the wholse set of all available types (and values for that matter).

`string & number` produce an empty set because there is no common values between those two types.
