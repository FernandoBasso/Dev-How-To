Basically, we have to discover the number of elements in the sequence. For example, from -2 to 4 we have 6 elements. To achive that, we can use the formula

[source,text]
----
greaterNumber - smallerNumber + 1
4 - (-2) = 6
----

So, our algorithm should first detect which number is the greater, which is the smallest, and then apply the logic described above.

Finally, after we have the number of elements in the sequence, we apply the formula to sum the sequence, which is:

[source,text]
----
n * (max + min) / 2
----

Basically, we want to get the average of the first and last terms multiplied by the number of terms.
