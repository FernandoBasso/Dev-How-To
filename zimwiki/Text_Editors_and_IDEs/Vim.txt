Works!
set includeexpr=substitute(v:fname,'app','src','')

““
It's not the function which is the problem, it's that you're using it in a :set [option]

===== Working With Options =====

See '':help options'' to learn about the subject. Other useful things follow.

==== Place the value of option into the buffer ====

From insert mode type ''Ctrl-r'' followed by ''='', which makes the command line at the bottom wait for the rest of the command. Then type ''&'' followed by the name of an option, like ''listchars''. and end it with ''<CR>''.

==== Copy value of option to clipboard ====

'''
:help clipboard
:help x11-selection
'''

Vim uses the register ‘''*''’ for the primary X11 selection, and the register ‘''+''’ for the clipboard. So, to “copy” to the primary selection or the clipbaord, we must “assing” stuff to those register. Registers are assigned to with the syntax ‘''@<register-name> = <value>''’, like ‘''@z = 'foo'''’ to assign the the string “foo” to the register ‘''z''’.

Example with the option ‘listchars’ using the clipboard:

'''
:let @+ = &listchars
'''

Now you can ''Ctrl-v'' in some other application to paste the contents of the clipboard.

Example with the option ‘listchars’ using the primary selection:

'''
:let @* = &listchars
'''

Now you can middle-click in some other application to paste the contents of the primary selection.
