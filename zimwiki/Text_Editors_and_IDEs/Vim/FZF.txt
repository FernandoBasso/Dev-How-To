====== FZF ======
Created Wednesday 05 August 2020

Nice video about vim and fzf:
https://www.chrisatmachine.com/Neovim/08-fzf/

Ugly colors in preview window:
https://github.com/junegunn/fzf.vim/issues/969

So, something like

''BAT_THEME=Github THEME=light vim src/main.c''


Also talks about cani to amazingly quickly check caniuse for stuff!
