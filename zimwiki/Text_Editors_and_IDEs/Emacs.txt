===== org-mode hide markup =====
[10:43:11] <Fernando-Basso> Is there currently anyway to have org-mode hide //, ~ ~, and #+begin_<thing> #+end_<thing>?
[10:44:00] <Fernando-Basso> s/anyway/any way/ :|
[10:53:41] <dgrade> org-meta-line is the face that governs how these lines look. I just gray them out
[10:56:03] <dgrade> I've also seen a really neat hack that essentially uses prettify symbols to make the delimters foldable, see https://pank.eu/blog/pretty-babel-src-blocks.html

===== Show untracked files in directories =====
(same for Vim Fugitive)

''$ git config --local status.showUntrackedFiles all''

===== Racket Stuff =====
* https://lisp.sh/switch-to-racket-mode-in-emacs/


===== REPLs =====
If the repl keeps open at the bottom, first do ''C-x 3'' (to open a new split on the right), then run a command the opens the REPL.

===== repl racket-mode trailing whitespace =====

greghendershott@#racket irc
Fernando-Basso: (setq show-trailing-whitespace nil), for example in a racket-repl-mode-hook.
Or, since I think it is nil by default, change some hook you have that is doing (set show-trailing-whitespace t).
show-trailing-whitespace is buffer-local, so it can be on or off for different buffers.
I usually disable it for magit-mode.
I enable it in prog-mode-hook, in my personal config, which enables it for racket-mode.
But racket-repl-mode is not derived from prog-mode.
In my personal config I don't seem to disable it for racket-repl-mode. I think it's just off by default and I leave it off by default.
So I think probably you have something that enables it, and, you just want to stop doing that?
Or leave that thing, and explicitly disable it for racket-repl-mode.
Up to you, not sure about your config.
Fernando-Basso
I have editorconfig.
greghendershott: Thanks a lot.
