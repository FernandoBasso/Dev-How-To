===== LightDM Gtk Greeter =====
On Arch Linux, I can set a login screen wallpaper from Lightdm Gtk Greeter Settings, and use a different wallpaper from the normal desktop. On Xubuntu, even if you set a wallpaper for the login screen, it just momentarily shows it, and then defaults back to the same set on the user's desktop.
