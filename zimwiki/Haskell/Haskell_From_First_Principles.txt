===== Sectioning =====
‘(-1) 2’ does not create sectioning and partially apply subtraction to the value 1. When used like that, on the left side of a number, it means negation of the number sign, not subtraction.

‘subtract’ is prefix, which means this sectioning works:

λ> (subtract 1) 0
-1

But this does not work:

λ> (1 subtract) 0
...error...

But we can make it infix:

λ> (1 `subtract`) 0
-1
