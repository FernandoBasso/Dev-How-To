====== ch10 Folding Lists ======
Created Monday 17 February 2020

===== Folds =====

Folding is a concept that extends in usefulness and importance beyond lists, but lists are often how they are introduced. Folds as a general concept are called catamorphisms. You’re familiar with the root “morphism” from polymorphism. “Cata-” means “down” or “against,” as in “catacombs.” Catamorphisms are a means of decon- structing data. If the spine of a list is the structure of a list, then a fold is what can reduce that structure.

===== Bringing you into the fold =====

Where map applies a function to each member of a list and returns a list, a fold replaces the cons constructors with the function and reduces the list.

'''
λ> :t map
map :: (a -> b) -> [a] -> [b]

λ> :t foldr
foldr :: Foldable t => (a -> b -> b) -> b -> t a -> b

λ> map (+ 1) [1..5]
[2,3,4,5,6]

λ> foldr (+) 0 [1..5]
15
