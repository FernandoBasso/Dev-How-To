===== Random notes =====

The ''activate'' signal is sent when the application is launched with ''g_application_run()''.

Declare a ''GtkWidget *window'' but instantiate it to a window with ''window = gtk_application_window_new (app);''. When using ''window'', we have to cast it from ''GtkWidget'' to ''GtkWindow'' using the macro ''GTK_WINDOW''.

According to mclasen@gtk riot/irc, these casts and are mainly habit. Nothing especial. Could have declared as ''GtkWindow *window'' in the first place (instead of ''GtkWidget *window'').

===== g_signal_connect() vs g_signal_connect_swapped() =====

Reast last paragraph of [[https://developer.gnome.org/gtk3/stable/gtk-getting-started.html|this link]]. Then, in devhelp, read about ''g_signal_connect_swapped()''.

""
''g_signal_connect_swapped()'' allows you to specify what the callback function should take as parameter by letting you pass it as data. In this case the function being called back is ''gtk_widget_destroy()'' and the window pointer is passed to it. This has the effect that when the button is clicked, the whole GTK window is destroyed. In contrast if a normal ''g_signal_connect()'' were used to connect the "clicked" signal with ''gtk_widget_destroy()'', then the button itself would have been destroyed, not the window.
