===== [‚úó] Basarat TypeScript Guide =====
[DATETIME: Sat, 2020-09-19 13:52]
https://basarat.gitbook.io/typescript/
**NOTE**: This book is not a hands on thing. Sure, it has examples, but it doesn't get you actually ‚Äúprogramming‚Äù in TypeScript. It is a quick reference. Better to do a project with TypeScript and consult and research things (on this book or on the web).

**NOTE**: I'll not ‚Äústudy‚Äù this book. I'll read the parts I need, when I need it, or I'll read it at leisure to know what stuff exists and what can be done.
