===== Gtk Themes =====

==== Greybird ====

Xournal looks ugly under Greybird / Xfce4. Running from the terminal, we see complains about missing “murrine” engine. Installing “gtk-engine-murrine” makes Xournal look good.

Look at the “Optional For” entry in ''pacman -Qi gtk-engine-murrine'' and the “Optional Deps” entry in ''pacman -Qi xfce-theme-greybird''.
