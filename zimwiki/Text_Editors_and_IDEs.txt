===== editorconfig max_line_length =====
[DATETIME: Mon, 2020-04-27 05:59]

Looks like both Atom and VSCode do not honor editorconfigs ‘max_line_length’ setting. They do not “reflow” lines respecting that setting. They seem to “reflow” lines using their own default values for line length.

Vim, on the other hand, does honor that setting without any trouble at all. Even to reformat/reflow comments simply use ‘gq’ and be done with it!
