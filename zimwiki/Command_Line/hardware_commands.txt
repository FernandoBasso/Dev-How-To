===== motherboard revisions =====
""
When searching for products some of the models may have different revisions, how do I distinguish between the different revisions of the same model?

The version or revision numbers are printed on the PCB on all range of GIGABYTE's Motherboard. You can find the corresponding "REV: 1.0" on the top left corner of the Motherboard (Please check reference chart). When you wish to update either bios or driver please make sure the correct driver or bios is selected to correspond to your Revision of motherboard.

motheboard revision: every time they change something on the motherboard that isn't rather significant they market it as the same motherboard, just under a different revision (other capacitor brands, better PCB, etc.) <- simplest explanation I can give

bios revision: every time they change/improve/fix something in the BIOS, it's a new revision

vendor: manufacturer, I think. Either that or who sold it to you (retailer)

Think of it like versions of the same product.

A BIOS revision can add compatibility with certain components (CPUs, memory, etc.) or fix bugs in previous versions

You can find your motherboard revision in Dxdiag sometimes. Or you can just look on the motherboard itself.
