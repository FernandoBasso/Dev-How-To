===== Gotchas =====

==== empty file ====

If you do
'''
cat foo.txt 's/this/that/' > foo.txt
'''
you'll end up with an empty foo.txt because sed is writing to the same file that cat is reading.



===== replace special chars with their simpler version =====

Nice discussion on several things, like ranges and locales.
