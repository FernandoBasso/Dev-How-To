                          | '#{session_name}:#{window_index}.#{pane_index}' \ |   
                          | xargs -I PANE tmux send-keys -t PANE "$@" C-j When I  
                          | do myscript echo hello, the sent keys to tmux end up  
                          | as 'echohello'. What I am doing wrong?                
10:39:07   Fernando-Basso | I expected "$@" to expand to 'echo hello' with the    
                          | space.                                                
10:40:00   Fernando-Basso | (and I am not using tmux built-in synchronize-panes   
                          | because I want to send a command to all windows and   
                          | panes of current session, not just the panes of the   
                          | current window)                                       
10:40:05             osse | "$@" expands to "echo" "hello" as separate arguments  
10:40:39   Fernando-Basso | Okay, so I can probably just do myscript 'echo        
                          | hello'. But is there a more advisable way?            
10:41:01             osse | this is one of those cases where using "$*" makes     
                          | sense                                                 
10:41:31   Fernando-Basso | Oh, indeed! I never had a chance to use it before for 
                          | in a real situation.                                  
10:42:07   Fernando-Basso | Thanks a lot osse!
