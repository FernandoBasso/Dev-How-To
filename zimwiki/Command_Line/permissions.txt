====== permissions ======
Created Thursday 12 April 2018

===== execute binary 774 permission denied =====
Uploaded `jpegoptim' binary to a `''server:~/bin/''` and although it was owned by me and had had executable permissions for the user and group, couldn't run it:

'''
-rwxrwxr-- 1 theuser theuser 106698 Apr 12 07:34 jpegoptim*
-bash-3.2$ ./bin/jpegoptim
-bash: ./bin/jpegoptim: Permission denied
-bash-3.2$ 
'''

It so happens that the filesystem is mounted with the `''noexec''` option in /etc/fstab. Out of look since this is a shared host.
