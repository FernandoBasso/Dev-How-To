===== execute binary 774 permission denied =====
Uploaded `jpegoptim' binary to a `''server:~/bin/''` and although it was owned by me and had had executable permissions for the user and group, couldn't run it:

'''
-rwxrwxr-- 1 theuser theuser 106698 Apr 12 07:34 jpegoptim*
-bash-3.2$ ./bin/jpegoptim
-bash: ./bin/jpegoptim: Permission denied
-bash-3.2$ 
'''

It so happens that the filesystem is mounted with the ‘noexec’ option in ‘/etc/fstab’.


===== default group and user IDs =====

There is no standard which defines which groups have which IDs across *nixes, distros, etc.

On Xubunt, the group “users” has an ID of 100; on Arch Linux, 985.
