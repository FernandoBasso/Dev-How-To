 is a bash built-in. ''help command''.

----
'''
$ help command 
command: command [-pVv] command [arg ...]
    Execute a simple command or display information about commands.
    
    Runs COMMAND with ARGS suppressing  shell function lookup, or display
    information about the specified COMMANDs.  Can be used to invoke commands
    on disk when a function with the same name exists.
    
    Options:
      -p    use a default value for PATH that is guaranteed to find all of
            the standard utilities
      -v    print a description of COMMAND similar to the `type' builtin
      -V    print a more verbose description of each COMMAND
    
    Exit Status:
    Returns exit status of COMMAND, or failure if COMMAND is not found.

NOTE that it says "runs COMMAND" and "suppressing shell function lookup".

If you have a bash function ''sync'' and also a ''/usr/bin/sync'' program/command, in your shell script, the function will take precedence over the command, and you do ''command sync'' to execute ''/usr/bin/sync'' instead, if you so desire.
