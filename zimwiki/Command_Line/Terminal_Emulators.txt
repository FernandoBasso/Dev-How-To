====== Terminal Emulators ======
Created Thursday 26 March 2020

__NOTE__: No matter how much I research or what configs I try, it looks like old shcool terminal emulators like Xterm and URxvt cannot beat new-wave (VTE-based) terminals like mate-terminal or xfce4-terminal when it comes to handling multibyte/unicode chars.

===== Gruvbox Vim Theme =====
Has A LOT of good info about terminals, perks, tips, commands to query info, etc. Amazing docs!

===== xterm =====

xterm -xrm 'XTerm.vt100.allowTitleOps: false' -T 'λ Always Be Awesome! λ'


===== rxvt-unicode urxvt =====

“I've used urxvt in the past, but it is utterly unable to handle unicode characters.”
