====== Terminal Emulators ======
Created Thursday 26 March 2020

__NOTE__: No matter how much I research or what configs I try, it looks like old shcool terminal emulators like Xterm and URxvt cannot beat new-wave (VTE-based) terminals like mate-terminal or xfce4-terminal when it comes to handling multibyte/unicode chars.

===== Gruvbox Vim Theme =====
Has A LOT of good info about terminals, perks, tips, commands to query info, etc. Amazing docs!

===== xterm =====

xterm -xrm 'XTerm.vt100.allowTitleOps: false' -T 'λ Always Be Awesome! λ'


===== rxvt-unicode urxvt =====

“I've used urxvt in the past, but it is utterly unable to handle unicode characters.”


===== Terminator =====

https://askubuntu.com/questions/158159/how-do-i-get-terminator-to-start-up-with-my-custom-layout

My display has dimensions 1920x1080 pixels, so:
(1920 - 1320) / 2 = 320
(1080 - 960) / 2 = 60

terminator --geometry=1320x960+320-60 --title 'λ Always Be Awesome! λ'

===== Don't change Terminator main workflow =====
I would like to express my supremely humble opinion about some points regarding the future of Terminator. My goal is to elaborate on once specific thing I think shouldn't be changed because they it is very useful precisely because the way it designed designed, which is saving and restoring of sessions.

Nowadays we also have Tilix (besides Tmux and Screen which are multiplexers and not terminal emulators per se). Tilix is looks very modern and is very up to date. Its main features overlap with those found in Terminator. Yet, I believe Terminator overall design and decisions have bee proved more reasonable and useful to the end user so far.

Terminator has layouts, Tilix has sessions. Terminator layouts allow one to **group several panes _and_ tabs together** and reopen them with `terminator -s`, `terminator -l my-layout` or with the default key binding `Ctrl-l` (the layout launcher). Tilix, sadly, seems to consider only the current view and its panes a single group (sessions) that can be restored at once later.

The main reason I choose Terminator over Tilix is this ability to save and restore an entire group of tabs and split panes at once.

I see lots of things that could be improved in the the sessions are stored, the UI to config them, etc, but the main idea of tabs and panes as a group that can be stored and saved as a unit is amazing and I hope this main idea is never changed to something like Tilix or some other less useful approach.
