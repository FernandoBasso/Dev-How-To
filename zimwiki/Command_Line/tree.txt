===== Failed to pay attention to man page again =====
[DATETIME: Fri, 2020-03-13 06:58]

Read the man page, and yes, I can ignore ‘node_modules/’ with ‘-I node_modules’. But how can I ignore two directories? Neither of the following worked:

* ‘-I node_modules,coverage’
* ‘-I node_modules coverage’
* ‘-I node_modules -I coverage’

Search the web, and sure enough, found [[https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/47805/how-do-we-specify-multiple-ignore-patterns-for-tree-command|this]]:

'''
-I pattern
      Do not list those files that match the wild-card pattern.
'''

Which is precisely what the man page I had read says. See‽ “wild-card pattern”. I should have payed attention to each and every word. Once in #bash someone told me, “man pages are written with extreme care, and should be read likewise.”. Also, I now that “pattern” means. I just failed to make the connection because of my hurry to find the solution and lack of attention.

Here's what works:

'''
~/Projects/github-followers [(ef0b7de...) ✔]

$ tree -C -I 'node_modules|coverage'
