====== What I Do ======
Created Sunday 15 March 2020

I have been working with web development using several different technologies for over 10 years, ranging from small responsive websites to large admin panels, applications and e-commerce websites. I'm most comfortable with HTML, CSS, ECMAScript, TypeScript, Ruby, Rails, PHP, Laravel, Node.js, React, Vue.js, Shell Scripting, Linux, TDD. I can work with OO, FP, or procedural code and love them all. Other languages that I have played with are Scheme, Haskell and C.

I'm passionate about Valve, Steam and have great respect for the work you have been doing for Linux users (my case) and open source in general! Working for and with you would be the opportunity of a lifetime.
