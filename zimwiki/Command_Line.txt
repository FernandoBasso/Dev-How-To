On most terminals, ‘Ctrl-v’ then Tab inserts a literal tab. With Bash (and some other shells), writting ‘$'\t'’ also produces a literal Tab character.

'''
$ printf '%s\n' $'X\tY\tZ'
X       Y       Z
'''




===== Keybindings =====


''Esc-.'' (Esc followed by a dot) inserts last argument of the last param, similar to what ''!$'' would do.

See [[https://www.reddit.com/r/vim/comments/r38nd/if_you_use_vimode_under_bash_and_you_miss_escdot/|this]] for ''vi'' mode workarounds.

'''
$ set -o vi
$ bind -m vi-command ".":insert-last-argument
'''

Use it by ''Esc+.''. Remember that in Vi/Vim and some other programs, ''Esc'' can be achieved with ''C-['' as well.
