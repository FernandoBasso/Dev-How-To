====== Reduce ======
Created Monday 16 March 2020

===== Strange reduce result =====

'''
$ node -i
> ['hey', 'you', 'there'].reduce((acc, t) => ({ ...acc, [t]: t }));
{ '0': 'h', '1': 'e', '2': 'y', you: 'you', there: 'there' }
'''

Have seen similar output a few times with ramda as well. Turns out the problem is we forgot to provide the initial accumulator!
