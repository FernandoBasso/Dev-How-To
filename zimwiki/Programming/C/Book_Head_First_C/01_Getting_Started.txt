Convert C code to machine code.

'''
$ gcc -std=c99 -Wall -pedantic -o main main.c
'''

* Write C code.
* Compiler checks for errors and compiles the C source code.
* Compiler creates the //executable// which is a stream of 0s and 1That is the program we can actually run.

C: Speed, space, portability.

Three standars:
* ANSI C, or C89, late 1980s.
* C99, 1989 standard that fixed some stuff FROM C89.
* C11, from 2011.

We use the extension “c” for C source files, like “main.c”. The “.c” extension is just a convention, but we'd better follow it.

C itself is very small and can do almost nothing without external libraries like stdio or stdlib.

stdio: standard input and output (read and write data to the terminal).

The ‘''main''’ function is the starting point of all C programs. That name is important. Without that function the program won't start.

A return type ‘''int''’ is a way to communicate the OS about the exit status. 0 for success, and non-zero (1, 3, -1, etc) for some sort of failure.

‘''printf''’ is used for formatted outpout. Each each ‘''%''’ parameter must have a matching variable:

'''
printf ("%s age is %d.\n", "Yoda", 900);
// Produces “Yoda age is 900.”
'''

* stdio.h: printf, scanf, and much more. See ‘''man stdio.h''’.
* stdlib.h: atoi, and much more. See ‘''man stdlib.h''’.

Comments are inside ''/* ... */''. . If the compiler supports C99 (and , then ''//'' comments are also valid.

GCC supports ANSI C, C99, C11 and others. See in the [[https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/C-Dialect-Options.html|GCC docs]].

The computer/processor does not run C code. It runs compiled (binary, machine code) only.

Compiling and running:

'''
$ gcc -std=c99 -Wall -pedantic -o main main.c
$ ./main
'''

C doesn't have strings natively. It supports array of single byte chars. Libraries provide string utilities, though.

The string ''"jedi"'' is just an array of chars ''{'j', 'e', 'd', 'i', '\0'}''.

'''
j  e  d  i \0
0  1  2  3  4
'''

The initials for “Master Yoda”, “M”, “Y”, but we also need space for the NUL terminator ''\0''.

'''
char initials[3] = {'M', 'Y', '\0'};
'''

A double-quoted string ''"bar"'' is an alias for the array ''{'b', 'a', 'r'}''.

Single quotes for chars, double quotes for string literals.

String literals are constant, character arrays can be changed after they are created. If you try to change a string literal, the compiler will likely display a bus error (it can't update a piece of memory).

The ''return 0;'' in the ''main'' function means success, and any other number means some sort of failure. Yet, in a boolean context ''0'' is “falsy” and any other number is “truthy”. C99 allows the use of the keywords ''true'' and ''false'', but compilers interpret them as 1 and 0 anyway.

'''
if (flag != 0)
'''
 is the same thing as ''if (flag)''.
