====== Fill Form Helper ======

===== The Type Guesser =====

1. Fetch all elements of a form.
2. Go through each element, and decide on its type (email, firstname, range, date, randon/unspecified string).
3. Return the reference to the element + its inferred type?
4. Based on each type, fire the specific function that will fill-up/check/mark that element.

Perhaps, for fields that cannot be more precisely guessed, we could ask the user to provide a type from a list of sellectable types? In HTML5, when an input doesn't have a type, or it is an unsupported type, it defaults to text.

IDEA: Generate all the data for the form beforehand? Like, having an object structure with the elements in the data to insert in each?

text, setAttribute
email, setAttribute
checkbox.checked = true;
