RestFULL.

Register:
* POST /users
Sessions (login, logout):
* POST /sessions. POSTing to and endpoint is used to create a resource, so POST to sessions create a new session, that is, produces a login session, returns the token that the user can use to make further authenticated requests to other protected resources.

The paths and baseUrl compiler options don't cause any remapping of imports paths, they only inform TS of existing mappings, which you'll have to setup with some other tool.

How to make it work:

'''
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "baseUrl": ".",
    "target": "es6",
    "module": "CommonJS",
    "moduleResolution": "node",
    "rootDir": "./",
    "outDir": "./build",
    "esModuleInterop": true,
    "strict": true
  }
}
'''


And then ''NODE_PATH=. nodemon src/index.ts''.

That is, use only **baseUrl** but **do not use paths**.
