Why gnome-builder creates a file that imports memoapp-config.h?

Ah, I opened it in Builder, and it is a “meson generated file, do not edit”. Probably something Builder does as the default template for a C/Gtk project.

well it comes from meson.build, possibly with a config.h.in it's a fairly common convention to avoid multiple truths for version numbers etc
