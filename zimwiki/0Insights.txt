===== About Zim vs Markdown vs Asciidoctor =====
[DATETIME: Fri, 2020-09-18 19:41]
It is not worthwhile to use Markdown or Asciidoctor to write something that is not a //real// project. For quick notes, links, solutions, tips, random stuff, it is simply quicker and easier to write in a nice WYSIWYG program like Zim, which has the Tree TOC views (side bars), which makes Zim the most navigable and searchable program ever for note taking. Only use Markdown or Asciidoctor for real projects, real documentation.

**NOTE**: It is easy to write in Markdown and Asciidoctor. That is not the problem. The problem is that you have to handle styles, write in the editor, render, and check in the browser or a preview window, etc. It is much more time consuming than simply jotting down stuff on Zim or even plain text files (because they don't require the step of going back and forth from the ‚Äúsource‚Äù to the preview window.) It causes cognitive burden to go from the markup code, and find what changed in the preview window (even when they are synchronized and their scroll is kept in sync).

===== Starting and Stopping stuff =====

Why do I start a book, course, project, and then stop and think ‚Äúlater I'll get back to this‚Äù?

I have this burning desire to know and learn about EVERYTHING. Ok, I get that, but I must come to terms with myself, my life and understand that time is a very limited resource.

===== About using new tools =====

Just tried to use dired to copy a .rkt file. Spent 20 minutes and couldn't do it. Typing ''C'' in the dired view would say ‚ÄúNo files specified‚Äù. Heck, the cursor **was** on a file... üí©Ô∏è The problem was that I had done ''C-u C-x d'' (instead of plain ''C-x d'') and I did an ''ls -a'' instead of ''ls -al'' and it seems Dired uses a regex to parse filenames from the date, etc.

Moral of the story. Study a tool before trying to use it. Read the manual, or at least some introductory texts about it. Spent time _NOT_ studying the book, but instead researching and asking why the fuck ''C'' didn't work.
